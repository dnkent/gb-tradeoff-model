# Question

How do states lessen the severity of the security dilemma?

---

class: left, middle

# Security Dilemma 

+ The means by which a state makes itself more secure make others less secure.

+ Jervis (1978): 3520 citations according to Google Scholar

+ Glaser (1997): 615 citations

+ Etc.

# Spiral Model

+ Worst case scenario: reciprocal spirals of insecurity lead to war

+ Even if no war, economic costs (Fearon, 2018) and damage to trust (Kydd, 2007) are mutually undesirable

# Sources of variation

+ Distinguishable intentions
    + Can defensive intentions be distinguished from offensive intentions?

+ Offense-Defense Balance
    + Do dominant military technologies favor offense or defense?

---

class: left, middle

# But...

+ Distinguishable intentions: 
    + Copeland: **Uncertainty of *future* intentions**
    + Fearon: **Incentives to misrepresent private information: *why not act defensive?* **
    + Snyder and Borghard: **Leaders prefer to not fully reveal intentions or tie their hands to one set path**

+ Offense-Defense Balance: 
    + Biddle: **Technological balance is murky, * capability employment* matters most**
    + Glaser and Kaufmann: **Incredibly hard to operationalize**

# Puzzle

+ Theoretically, the problem appears inescapable

# Puzzle

+ Even in rivalries where an issue is under dispute, it is not clear if a spiral is present. Equally as plausible, one state may be just keeping up and attempting to deter the larger state.

# Puzzle

+ So what gives? Why this gap between theory and reality?

---

class: left, middle


# Argument


**For almost all states, the security dilemma is largely irrelevant. Military parity with leading powers is *economically infeasible*.**


Often, the only way to win is not to play.

# Why a computational model? 

+ Most important variable is not observable in reality: percent of *available* capital to military. 
    + The state cannot access all GDP and current national expenditures could be larger.

+ Easily links domestic explanations of foreign policy (e.g. Weeks (2014), Milner and Tingley (2015)) and systemic/structural approaches (e.g. Braumoeller (2013), Waltz (1979)) 

+ Speaks to formal literature of political economy of national security (e.g. Fearon (2018), Poast (2019))

# Model

+ Computational model of state growth and military spending in an n-player system.

+ Setup:
    + 14x14 grid
    + One agent (state) per cell
    + Parameters:
        + GDP
        + Growth 
        + Max extractable capital
        + Domestic needs
        + Military size

---
class: left, middle

# Model

+ Decision rule:
    1. Record each neighbor's military size
    2. Assess the difference between the size of each neighbor's military and one's own 
    3. Calculate available capital
        + (GDP * extractable capital) - domestic needs
    4. Consider $n$ largest neighbors for balancing
        + $n$ can be varied from 1 to 8
    5. Balance against the largest neighbor possible
    6. If each of $n$ largest neighbors is too large to balance against, then save capital
    7. Military spending is removed from GDP

# Concluding points 

+ By varying state size and including a simple-guns butter tradeoff, only under the most extreme circumstances do most states spend the majority of available capital on the military.

+ How to best externally validate? 

+ Literatures this speaks to:
    + Hierarchy: *Why are states willing to cede autonomy to a hierarch?* 
    + Nuclear weapons: *Why risk going nuclear?*
    + Spiral vs. Deterrence Model: *Contradictory prescriptions and explanations, which fits best?*
